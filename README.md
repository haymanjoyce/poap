This is a Python application for viewing Gantt charts.

It is meant for professional project planners to use.

Sometimes planners need to produce detailed and engaging "Plans on a Page (POAP)".

This tool addresses this need.

It generates vector graphics from data (there is no hand drawing involved).

Users interact with the tool via a Command Line Interface (CLI).

The data is held and edited in a Microsoft Excel workbook (i.e. spreadsheet).

There is one spreadsheet per chart (the tool calls the 'POAP' a 'chart').

To get started, install the tool into your Python environment and enter 'poap' into the command line.
